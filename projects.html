                    <p>While I mainly focus on my professional career, I do like to be creative. My new album "Think About It" has been in development for six months now, and I am excited to say that it is soon to be released on all streaming platforms. (after I finish two more songs...)</p>

			<img src="assets/images/edposter.jpg" alt="Capstone Poster" class="interactive-image">
                    <p>For my capstone at Centralia College, I decided to research the process of Electrodialysis. I decided to constrain my research to be repeatable by an "at home enthousiast." This meant small-budget and no fancy tools. After my research was completed, I synthesized this poster which is still hanging in the hall to this day.</p>
