                    <p>While I mainly focus on my professional career, I do like to be creative. My new album "Think About It" has been in development for six months now, and I am excited to say that it has been released on all streaming platforms!</p>

			<img src="assets/images/channel.jpg" alt="Channel Excavations of Milltown Island" class="interactive-image">
                    <p>As of recently, I got to be a part of the WDFW project coordination team restoring the estuaries on Milltown Island. The project had many difficulties that we had to overcome, such as unsuitable soil conditions. Regardless, upon completion of this project, (projected to be October 2024) the Island will be restored to it's native condition. </p>

                    <p>For my capstone at Centralia College, I decided to research the process of Electrodialysis. I decided to constrain my research to be repeatable by an "at-home enthusiast." This meant small-budget and no fancy tools. After my research was completed, I synthesized this poster which is still hanging in the hall to this day.</p>
